DropboxTi
=========

I have moved our company repositories to our organisation repos. So the new repo address is <https://github.com/ClinicalSoftwareSolutions/DropboxTi>

Please update any links you may have.

If you have already cloned the repository then either clone again or you can update the remote url using

    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ClinicalSoftwareSolutions/DropboxTi

for SSH and

    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ClinicalSoftwareSolutions/DropboxTi

for HTTPS
